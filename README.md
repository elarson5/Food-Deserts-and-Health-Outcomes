# Food Deserts and Health Outcomes

> The purpose of this project is to understand how food deserts impact the health outcomes (obesity and diabetes) of the populations that reside in them. Broadly speaking, food deserts are areas with limited access to affordable and or nutritious food. They are often associated with a lower quality of health and life by those that reside in them. To quantify this impact requires careful analysis of food accessibility and public health data. In this project, several indicators of food deserts are used in a multiple regression model to understand their impact on diabetes and obesity.
